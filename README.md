# Calcite for AlmaLinux

Calcite is an AlmaLinux bootc-based system with GNOME. It is designed for AlmaLinux and others to easily extend it or even just rebrand it.

> [!WARNING]
> Setting up an internet connection is mandatory, otherwise installation will fail. If you can't set up an internet connection, do not install this software.

## Notes

- We remove `/usr/share/console-login-helper-messages/profile.sh` and it's symlink as it would cause errors in terminals that can be ignored.

## Download

[Download the ISO](https://github.com/CalciteAuthors/calcite/releases/latest/download/9.iso), or use your favorite way to provision a device with bootc.
